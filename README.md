# AddressBook

An address book program is useful for storing and managing contacts. It will be easy to have all your contacts in one place where you can add, edit, delete, or display everyone’s information. The user should be able to input the contact’s name, phone number, and address. The user should be able edit the contact by updating the information or delete the contact. Lastly, the user should be able to see the contact’s information displayed and/or exit the program.

Example 1:
The options are to add, edit, display, delete a contact, or quit the program.
If the user chooses “add” they will be able to input the contact’s information as follows:
Enter name: John Doe
Enter address: 123 abc
Enter phone number: 1234567
The data will then be stored in a contact class and can now be edited, displayed, or deleted.
The same options will loop until the user chooses to quit the program.

Example 2:
If the user chooses “edit”, they can enter the name of the contact they want to edit and then update the name, address, and phone number of the contact.
Enter new name: Jane Doe
Enter new address: 123 abcd
Enter new phone number: 1234567
Contact edited should be displayed

Example 3:
The user chooses “add”
Enter name: Mary Poppins 
Enter address: 123 Sesame Street
Enter phone number: 3.14
An error message will display because phone number is set to type int. Only whole numbers are permitted.
